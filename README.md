This is my personal neovim config written in Lua.

## Pros

- Pure Lua script with nice speed
- Integrated with the commandline tools like grep and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Run fast with 90 plugins
- Easy to manage the plugins with a nice structure

## Installation

### git

You can use git to install these configuration files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tandy1229/nvim-lua ~/.config/nvim

# if you want it downloads faster you can run
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tandy1229/nvim-lua ~/.config/nvim
```

### Requirement

Just to Reading the plugin docs:-)

## Speed

With the lazy.nvim and the lua cache speed up, its startup time is just **49.5ms** which is test in the Macbook constructed with 1.4GHz 4 core 8th Intel Core i5.

Even without those plugins and so now in my opinion the neovim is becoming the most useful front end now.

Thank you for these great configs \~~~

> Ohhhh, lua script making the nvim different, and make it a different road compared to Vim. But neovim now always updates with breaking changes, I hope it can be more stable in the day:-). And I also hope Vim keep stable, VimScript9 can become better and better:-). I hope everything goes well.
