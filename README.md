This is my personal neovim config written in Lua.

## Pros

- Pure Lua script with nice speed
- Integrated with the command line tools like grep and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Run fast with 90 plugins
- Easy to manage the plugins with a nice structure

## Installation

### git

You can use git to install these configuration files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tandy1229/nvim-lua ~/.config/nvim

# if you want it downloads faster you can run
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tandy1229/nvim-lua ~/.config/nvim
```

### Requirement

Just to Reading the plugin docs:-)

With the lazy.nvim and the lua cache speed up, its startup time is just
**49.5ms** which is test in the MacBook constructed with 1.4GHz 4 core 8th
Intel Core i5.

Even without those plugins and so now in my opinion the neovim is becoming the
most useful front end now.
